# VoskJs

Vosk ASR offline engine transcript APIs for NodeJs developers.
Contains a simple HTTP transcript server.

VoskJs can be used for speech recognition processing in different scenarios:

- Single-user/standalone programs (e.g. perfect for single-user embedded systems) 
- Multi-user/multi-core server architectures 


## What's Vosk?

Vosk is an open source embedded (offline, on-device) speech-to-text engine 
which can run in real time also on small devices.
It's based on Kaldi, but Nikolay V. Shmyrev's Vosk offers a smart and performant interface!

## What's VoskJs?

The goal of the project is to:

1. Create an simple function API layer on top of already existing Vosk nodejs binding, 
   supplying main sentence-based speech-to-text functionalities: 

   - `loadModel(modelDirectory)`
 
     Loads once in RAM memory a specific Vosk engine model from a model directory.
 
   - `transcriptFromFile(fileName, model, options)` 
   - `transcriptFromBuffer(buffer, model, options)` 

     At run-rime, transcripts a speech file or buffer (in WAV/PCM format), 
     through the Vosk engine Recognizer. It supply speech-to-text transcript detailed info.

   Using the simple transcript interface you can build your standalone custom application, 
   accessing async functions suitable to run on a usual single thread nodejs program.

2. Use `voskjs` command line program to test Vosk transcript with specific models 
  (some tests and command line usage [here](tests/README.md)).

3. Use `httpServer`, a simple HTTP server to transcript speech files. Or build your own server.
   Some usage examples [here](examples/). 


## üõç Install 

### 1. Install Vosk engine and this nodejs module 

- Install vosk-api engine
  ```bash
  pip3 install vosk 
  ```
  See also: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/install

- Install this module, as global package if you want to use CLI command `voskjs` 
  ```bash
  npm install -g @solyarisoftware/voskjs
  ```


### 2. Install/Download Vosk models

```bash
mkdir your/path/models && cd models

# English large model
wget https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-en-us-aspire-0.2.zip
unzip vosk-model-en-us-aspire-0.2.zip

# English small model
wget http://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip
unzip vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip

# Italian model model
wget https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-it-0.4.zip
unzip vosk-model-small-it-0.4.zip
```

More about available Vosk models here: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

### 3. Demo audio files

Directory [`audio`](audio/) contains some English language speech audio files, 
coming from a Mozilla DeepSpeech repo.
Source: [Mozilla DeepSpeech audio samples](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.3/audio-0.9.3.tar.gz)
These files are used for some tests and comparisons.


## Usage 

Some transcript usage examples [here](examples) 

- [`voskjs` Command line utility](examples/README.md#voskjs-command-line-utility)
- [Simple transcript program](examples/README.md#simple-transcript-program) 
- [Transcript with grammar](examples/README.md#transcript-with-grammar) 

- [Transcript HTTP server](examples/README.md#transcript-http-server)
- [SocketIO server pseudocode](examples/README.md#socketio-server-pseudocode)


## üõ† Tests

Some tests / notes [here](tests/README.md):

- [Transcript using English language, large model](tests/README.md#transcript-using-english-language-large-model)
- [Transcript using English language, small model](tests/README.md#transcript-using-english-language-small-model)
- [Comparison between Vosk and Mozilla DeepSpeech (latencies)](tests/README.md#comparison-between-vosk-and-mozilla-deepspeech-latencies)
- [Multithread stress test (10 requests in parallel)](tests/README.md#multithread-stress-test-10-requests-in-parallel)
- [HTTP Server benchmark test](tests/README.md#http-server-benchmark-test)
- [Latency tests](tests/README.md#latency-tests) 


## To do

- üí£ Important open issue to be solved: https://github.com/solyarisoftware/voskJs/issues/3 
  with a temporrary workaround: https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/issues/516#issuecomment-833462121

- httpServer will also reply to an HTTP POST request receiving the speech WAV 
  file as binary data attached in the HTTP request:
  ```
   curl -X POST 'http:localhost:3000/transcript' \
    --header "Content-Type: audio/wav" \
    --data-binary "@speech.wav"
  ```

- Implement a simplified interface for all [Vosk-api functions](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/blob/master/nodejs/index.js)
- Deepen grammar usage with examples
- Review stress and performances tests (especially for the HTTP server)
- To speedup latencies, rethink transcript interface, maybe with an initialization phases, 
  including Model creation an the Recognizer(s) creation
